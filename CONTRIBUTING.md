### 3. Contribute Code

#### 📥 Clone the repo
```bash

#### 🧪 Run the project locally
1. Create a virtual environment
```bash
# Create a virtual environment

# Install all required libraries
uv sync
```

2. Install dependencies

uv sync --dev
```

3. Set environment variables

To run checks manually:
```bash
pre-commit run --all-files -c .pre-commit-config.yaml
